# 🌲 Sprint Planning - Urban Tree Explorer (Sprint 3)

## Sprint Goal
Implement interactive maps for park locations and walking itinerary features, including rating systems, user submissions, and tree heatmap visualization.

## Selected User Stories

### User Story 1: Park Location Map
**As a** PhD student, **I want to** explore and rate parks near Melbourne Connect **so that** I can find and share information about nearby recreational spaces.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Interactive map shows parks near Melbourne Connect
- Users can rate parks on 1-10 scale
- Users can submit new location markers with photos and descriptions
- Filter toggle for user-submitted markers
- Detailed information for specified parks (University Square, Lincoln Square, Argyle Square, Carlton Gardens)
- Minimum 3 photos per specified location
- YouTube video embeddings for at least 2 locations

### Estimation using Fibonacci Sequence
| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|--------------|
| Complexity | Medium - Multiple interactive features |
| Uncertainty | Medium - Integration of various data types |
| Dependencies | Medium - Relies on existing map infrastructure |
| Risk | Medium - User-generated content management |
| **Estimated Story Points** | **13** (based on team discussion) |

### User Story 2: Walking Itinerary Map
**As a** PhD student, **I want to** follow a predetermined walking route through Melbourne CBD **so that** I can learn about the city while understanding the tree coverage along my path.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Interactive map shows predetermined route through 11 locations
- Direction display for complete itinerary
- Rating system for each stop
- Tree heatmap visualization around walking path
- Clear distinction between itinerary markers and heatmap
- Accurate route display between all specified locations

### Estimation using Fibonacci Sequence
| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|--------------|
| Complexity | Medium - Complex visualization requirements |
| Uncertainty | Medium - Heatmap implementation |
| Dependencies | Medium - Relies on tree data and routing services |
| Risk | Medium - Performance with multiple data layers |
| **Estimated Story Points** | **13** (based on team discussion) |

# 🚀 Project Assumptions & Constraints - Urban Tree Explorer

## Project Assumptions

1. **Technology Stack Stability**
- WordPress version will remain stable and supported throughout the project duration
- All selected plugins will maintain compatibility with the core WordPress version
- Server resources allocated will be sufficient to handle concurrent user access and data processing

2. **Resource Availability and Expertise**
- Team members will have consistent access to development environments and necessary tools
- All team members have basic WordPress development experience
- All team members can dedicate 10-15 hours per week to the project
- Technical support from teaching staff will be available within 48 hours when requested

3. **Data Quality and Access**
- The City of Melbourne tree dataset will remain publicly accessible throughout the project
- Data format and structure will remain consistent with the current API specification
- Dataset updates will not significantly alter the core attributes being used

4. **Stakeholder Engagement and Requirements**
- Project requirements for each sprint will be finalized before sprint commencement
- Teaching staff will provide clarification on requirements within 24 hours of queries
- User acceptance criteria will remain stable within each sprint
- Feedback cycles will be completed within 3 business days of deliverable submission

5. **Timeline and Deliverables**
- Each sprint will maintain its originally planned duration of 2 weeks
- Public holidays and university breaks have been accurately accounted for in the schedule
- Integration testing periods of 3-5 days are sufficient for each major feature



## Project Constraints - Urban Tree Cover Explorer  

### 1. Time Constraints  
- **Constraint:** The MVP must be delivered within 6 weeks (3 sprints),  with approximately 100-150 total hours available for development.
- **Justification:** This timeline is fixed by the SWEN90016 course schedule, ensuring students can complete the project within the semester while balancing other academic responsibilities.

### 2. Technical Constraints  
- **Constraint:** Development must use the university’s pre-installed WordPress infrastructure.  
- **Justification:** Avoids additional setup costs and ensures compatibility with existing IT systems. Custom plugins or external tools may require approval.  

### 3. Data Constraints  
- **Constraint:** Tree coverage data is static and sourced exclusively from the City of Melbourne’s dataset.  
- **Justification:** Ensures compliance with licensing terms and simplifies integration. Real-time updates or third-party data sources are out of scope.  

### 4. User Access Constraints  
- **Constraint:** The platform will only be accessible to the SWEN90016 teaching team and tutors.  
- **Justification:** Reduces security risks and aligns with the project’s primary purpose (internal meetup planning).  

### 5. Scope Constraints  
- **Constraint:** Future extensions (e.g., sustainability campaigns) are excluded from the MVP.  
- **Justification:** Focuses development efforts on immediate needs (location selection and sharing) within the 6-week timeframe.  

### 6. Resource Constraints  
- **Constraint:** Limited to student team capacity (no external developers or testers).  
- **Justification:** Reflects the educational nature of the project, emphasizing skill development within the team.  

### 7.Requirement Ambiguity Constraints

- **Constraint:** The exact specifications for the location sharing and recommendations feature are not fully defined and will require refinement during project execution.
- **Justification:** As noted in the project background, this requirement will be clarified during Assignment 2, requiring flexibility in implementation planning.

## Sprint 1 Reflection
This documents the reflection and revision of existing constraints.
### 1. Technical Constraints
- **Constraint:** Development must use the university’s pre-installed WordPress infrastructure.  
- **Justification:** Existing IT systems may present problems that can only be solved by escalation. Custom plugins or external tools may require approval.  



### 2.Requirement Ambiguity Constraints

- **Constraint:** The exact specifications for features does not account for occsional details and will require refinement and client reviews during project execution.

## Sprint 2 Reflection
### 1. Technical Constraints
- **Constraint:** Development must use the university’s pre-installed WordPress infrastructure.  
- **Justification:** Existing IT systems may present problems, including server capabilities that can only be solved by escalation. dependenct plugins or external tools require approval.

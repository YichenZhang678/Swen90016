# Issue Log Tracker

This document serves as the central repository for tracking issues and defects identified during the project execution for Assignment 2. Maintaining an up-to-date issue log is critical to ensuring that problems are documented, addressed, and validated promptly, thereby supporting the overall quality of the project.


## 1. Purpose of the Issue Tracker

- **Centralised Records**: Keep all project issues in one place for easy reference.
- **Visibility**: Ensure that every team member is aware of existing issues and their current status.
- **Accountability**: Assign ownership for resolving each issue and clarify responsibilities.
- **Quality Assurance**: Promote a structured approach to detecting, fixing, and verifying defects.

## 2. Issue Logging Process

1. **Identify & Report**
   - As soon as an issue (technical defect, requirement gap, performance bottleneck, etc.) is discovered, log it in this document (or the project’s preferred issue-tracking tool).
   - Provide enough detail so that the issue can be reproduced and understood by the team.
2. **prioritise & Assign**
   - Assign an **Owner** who will be responsible for investigating and resolving the issue.
   - Determine **Severity** (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low) based on the potential impact on project functionality and timelines.
3. **Fix & Verify**
   - The **Owner** works on a solution or fix.
   - Once a fix is implemented, a designated tester (could be the same or a different team member) verifies the fix and updates the **Status** (Resolved, Closed, etc.).
4. **Closure**
   - An issue is marked as **Closed** after successful verification and no further action is required.
   - Comments and lessons learned may be captured for retrospective use.

## 4. Severity Definitions

- **Critical (🔴)**: Complete failure of a critical feature or system crash, blocking the user from proceeding. Requires immediate attention.
- **High (🟠)**: Serious issue that heavily impacts core functionality but may have a workaround in some scenarios.
- **Medium (🟡)**: Defect affecting non-critical functionality, can be scheduled for resolution in the ongoing or next sprint.
- **Low (🟢)**: Minor or cosmetic issue that does not hinder system functionality.

## Communication Escalation Strategy - Urban Tree Explorer

| Meeting Title | Location | Escalation Trigger | Contingency Plan |
|---------------|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Stand-up | Virtual | Team member misses two consecutive stand-ups | Schedule one-on-one catch-up; if pattern continues, escalate to teaching staff |
| Client Review | Virtual | Critical feature feedback requires significant rework | Schedule technical review; adjust sprint priorities |
| Sprint Planning | Project Room & Virtual | Unable to reach consensus on priority features | Escalate to teaching team for guidance; schedule separate refinement session |
| Sprint Review | Virtual | Critical functionality doesn't meet teaching team expectations | Schedule immediate retrospective; create plans for fixes |

**Note:** This was updated after Sprint 1, as face-to-face feature showcase and feedback is not viable, and have been conducted virtually.

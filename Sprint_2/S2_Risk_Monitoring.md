## 🟢 Resolved Risk: R-006 – WordPress Server Environment Limitations

**Risk Statement:**  
Expected moderate learning curve for WordPress → Server instability and limited plugin compatibility → Delays in feature implementation and lack of debugging support

- **Status:** Resolved (Previously Materialized in Sprint 1)
- **Original Impact:**  
  - WordPress server was inconsistent, affecting deployment and testing  
  - Map rendering could not be completed due to plugin/environment limitations  
  - Debugging was ineffective due to restricted platform access
- **Resolution Actions:**
  - Implemented server setting optimizations
  - Limited data points to 3000 to improve system stability
  - System now operating at acceptable performance levels
- **Outcome:**  
  Server environment stabilized after configuration adjustments and data optimization, allowing for reliable feature implementation and testing.

## 🟢 Resolved Risk: R-007 – IT Services Server Access Disruption

**Risk Statement:**  
Server access issues → Unable to deploy and test changes → Project timeline delays

- **Status:** Resolved
- **Impact:**  
  - Development team unable to access server environment
  - Sprint 2 timeline extended by 2 days
  - Deployment and testing activities blocked
- **Action Taken:**
  - Escalated to IT Services for investigation
  - Extended Sprint 2 deadline to accommodate delay
  - Awaiting resolution from IT Services team
- **Lesson Learned:**  
  Include potential IT infrastructure disruptions in risk planning and maintain clear communication channels with IT Services for quick resolution.

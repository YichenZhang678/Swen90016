# 🚀 Sprint Retrospective – Assignment 2

A Sprint Retrospective is a structured discussion where the team reflects on the past sprint to improve future performance. It focuses on successes, challenges, and actionable improvements. This retrospective was conducted immediately after Sprint 1 to capture insights before the start of the next sprint.

## Overview

| Category                | Details                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Meeting Facilitator** | Scrum Master                                                 |
| **Goal of the Meeting** | Reflect on sprint successes and challenges, and identify actionable improvements for future sprints. |
| **Attendees**           | Development Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner                |

## What Went Well

- ✅ **Interactive Map Development**: The team successfully integrated a map component that plots tree locations using a geo plugin. Despite technical challenges, we achieved a basic yet functional visualisation where clicking on markers reveals tree details (in line with our user story criteria).

- ✅ **Communication and Adaptability**: Daily stand-ups and sprint planning sessions enabled quick digestion of requirement changes and efficient work reassignment, ensuring that efforts were aligned with updated priorities.

- ✅ **Documentation Practices**: Keeping detailed logs on Git—including task assignments and risk updates—demonstrated effective project execution, as outlined by our repository structure.

## What Could Have Been Done Better

- ⏳ **Change of Requirements**

  During the sprint, the staff made an ad hoc decision (triggered by encountered issues) to remove the login page and two-factor authentication (2FA) features. Since several tasks had already been initiated based on the original requirements, our workflow was significantly disrupted. The lack of sufficient contingency planning and preventive measures led to some chaos. In future sprints, we will implement **mid-sprint checkpoints** and **proactive strategies** to better manage such sudden changes.

- ⏳ **WordPress Map Integration Issues**

  Adding the map (even an empty one) resulted in a full page crash. This critical technical hurdle was unforeseen and emphasises the need for **early prototyping** and **rigorous testing** of WordPress plugins before full integration.

- ⏳ **Dynamic Task Allocation Challenges**

  Although task assignments naturally emerged where team members took ownership as they encountered or researched specific WordPress functionalities the absence of **formally defined** work categories occasionally resulted in overlapping efforts and unclear boundaries. For instance, one team member independently explored a promising mapping plugin and led its prototyping, while another investigated core customisation options to improve page load performance. Although these ad hoc contributions showcased initiative and innovation, the lack of a clear task categorisation framework sometimes led to fragmented efforts.

## What We Will Do Differently

- ⏳ **Early Requirement Verification**: Introduce a mid-sprint checkpoint to validate and confirm feature requirements.

- ⏳ **Risk Management Enhancement**: Test WordPress plugins in a sandbox to uncover potential crashes before full integration, and document these risks during daily stand-ups.

- ⏳ **Improved Task Allocation**: Establish a structured approach to record and categorise task contributions clearly noting who proposed an idea or researched a feature so that responsibilities are better aligned.

- ⏳ **Technical Prototyping**: Develop a small-scale proof-of-concept to validate the stability of critical plugins prior to full deployment.

- ⏳ **Regular Communication of Changes**: Continuously monitor announcements from the teaching team and update the risk log accordingly to avoid misalignment.

## Actionable Items for Next Sprint

| Action Item                                                  | Owner                   | Due Date | Status        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| Set up a mid-sprint checkpoint to verify and confirm requirements | Scrum Master            | Sprint 2 | ⏳ In Progress |
| Test WordPress plugins in a sandbox environment for stability | Dev Team                | Sprint 2 | ⏳ In Progress |
| Establish a structured task categorisation framework         | Scrum Master & Dev Team | Sprint 2 | ⏳ To Do       |
| Organise a technical prototyping session before full plugin integration | Dev Team                | Sprint 2 | ⏳ To Do       |
| Regularly review teaching team announcements and update the risk log | Scrum Master            | Sprint 2 | ⏳ In Progress |

## Conclusion

This sprint underscored the dynamic nature of agile projects requirement changes are inevitable. The deactivation of the login and 2FA features taught us the value of early, continuous requirement verification. Moreover, the WordPress map crash incident highlighted the critical need for robust risk assessment and early technical prototyping. By refining our task categorisation and communication strategies, we aim for a more balanced and resilient approach as we progress into future sprints.
